a decentralized Robot Monitor application, where the robot is moving across a room (treated like a 6 by 6 grid). The robot always starts at position 1,1. The robot may move left, right, up and down by one grid square at a time, and it has a restriction that the Robot cannot immediately return to a square it has occupied. For example, if a Robot at (1,1) moves RIGHT to (1,2) its next move cannot be a move LEFT back to (1,1). When the robot reaches the position (6,6) it may exit and another robot immediately enters the room in position 1,1.
